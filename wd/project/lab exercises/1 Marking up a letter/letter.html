        <h3>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h3>
        
        Dear Eileen,<br><br>
        
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br> of your <span id="u">PhD</span> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
        
        <h3>Starting dates</h3>
        We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
        
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        
        Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
        
        You can find more information about <a href="">important university dates</a> on out website.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Subjects of study</strong><br><br>
        
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall <br>somewhere in the realm fo science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>by are as follows, in order of priority: <br>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C(86°F), when the <br>
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
        research to tak, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br>
        
        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctrate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around <br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>
            
            <dt>Iceland brownian shuffle</dt>
                <dd>Before the Iceland developed fore as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>involved huddling clode together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably <br>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
            
           <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in 1960s believed to have <br>discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>of Nothern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>because they were really cold.</dd>
        </dl>

        Yours sincerely,<br><br>
